# B-sh-Network-Scanner

# Network Vulnerability Scanner and Report Generator

A Bash script that scans a network, which should be done with consent or own network.

## Overview:
Lines of command to arrive at a finite result.

Right now it:

- Shows open ports and services
- Adds some placeholder info for vulnerabilities and suggestions

## Purpose/Learning:
To develop skills, as those ahead of me are miles ahead!

## Current Status:
It's moving along but in small increments.

## Future Goals:
None at the moment, just enjoying the torturous ride. :D  This is a new language.
